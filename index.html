                    Ernest Miller Hemingway (<a href="#" class="text-link">/ˈhɛmɪŋweɪ/ HEM-ing-way</a>; July 21, 1899 – July 2, 1961) was an American novelist, short-story writer and journalist. Known for an economical, understated style that influenced later 20th-century writers, he has been romanticized for his adventurous lifestyle and outspoken, blunt public image. Some of his seven novels, six short-story collections and two non-fiction works have become classics of American literature, and he was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in Literature.

                           Hemingway was raised in <a href="#" class="text-link">Oak Park, Illinois</a>, a suburb of <a href="#" class="text-link">Chicago</a>. After high school, he spent six months as a reporter for The Kansas City Star before enlisting in the Red Cross. He served as an ambulance driver on the <a href="#" class="text-link">Italian Front</a> in <a href="#" class="text-link">World War I</a> and was seriously wounded by shrapnel in 1918. In 1921, Hemingway moved to Paris, where he worked as a <a href="#" class="text-link">foreign correspondent</a> foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star and was influenced by the modernist writers and artists of the "Lost Generation" expatriate community. His debut novel, The Sun Also Rises, was published in 1926. In 1928, Hemingway returned to the U.S., where he settled in Key West, Florida. His experiences during the war supplied material for his 1929 novel A Farewell to Arms.

                           In 1937, Hemingway went to Spain to cover the <a href="#" class="text-link">Spanish Civil War</a>, which formed the basis for his 1940 novel For Whom the Bell Tolls, written in <a href="#" class="text-link">Havana, Cuba</a>. During <a href="#" class="text-link">World War II</a>, Hemingway was present with Allied troops as a journalist at the <a href="#" class="text-link">Normandy landings</a> and the <a href="#" class="text-link">liberation of Paris</a>. In 1952, his novel The Old Man and the Sea was published to considerable acclaim, and won the <a href="#" class="text-link">Pulitzer Prize for Fiction</a>. On a 1954 trip to Africa, Hemingway was seriously injured in two successive plane crashes, leaving him in pain and ill health for much of the rest of his life. He committed suicide at his house in Ketchum, Idaho, in 1961.

                           Ernest Miller Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899, in Oak Park, Illinois, an affluent suburb just west of <a href="#" class="text-link">Chicago</a>. to <a href="#" class="text-link">Clarence Edmonds Hemingway</a>, a physician, and Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician. His parents were well-educated and well-respected in Oak Park, a conservative community about which resident <a href="#" class="text-link">Frank Lloyd Wright</a> said, "So many churches for so many good people to go to." When Clarence and Grace Hemingway married in 1896, they lived with Grace's father, Ernest Miller Hall, after whom they named their first son, the second of their six children.

                           His sister Marcelline preceded him in 1898, and his younger siblings were Ursula in 1902, Madelaine in 1904, Carol in 1911, and <a href="#" class="text-link">Leicester</a> in 1915.[2] Grace followed the Victorian convention of not differentiating children's clothing by gender. With only a year separating them, Ernest and Marcelline resembled one another strongly. Grace wanted them to appear as twins, so in Ernest's first three years she kept his hair long and dressed both children in similarly frilly feminine clothing.

                       <p>
                        Grace Hemingway was a well-known local musician,[6] and taught her reluctant son to play the cello. Later he said music lessons contributed to his writing style, as evidenced in the "<a href="#" class="text-link">contrapuntal</a> structure" of For Whom the Bell Tolls.[7] As an adult Hemingway professed to hate his mother, although they shared similar enthusiastic energies.[6] His father, Dr. Clarence Hemingway, taught him <a href="#" class="text-link">woodcraft</a> during the family's summer sojourns at <a href="#" class="text-link">Windemere</a> on Walloon Lake, near Petoskey, Michigan, where Ernest learned to hunt, fish and camp in the woods and lakes of <a href="#" class="text-link">Northern Michigan</a>. These early experiences instilled in him a life-long passion for outdoor adventure and living in remote or isolated areas.[8]

                        Hemingway went to <a href="#" class="text-link">Oak Park and River Forest High School</a> in Oak Park between 1913 and 1917, where he competed in boxing, track and field, water polo, and football. He performed in the school orchestra for two years with his sister Marcelline, and received good grades in English.[6] During his last two years at high school he edited the school's newspaper and yearbook (the Trapeze and Tabula); he imitated the language of popular sportswriters and contributed under the pen name Ring Lardner Jr.—a nod to <a href="#" class="text-link">Ring Lardner</a> of the Chicago Tribune whose byline was "Line O'Type".[9] A remembrance garden to honor Hemingway was erected in front of the high school in 1996.[10]
                       </p>
                       <p>After leaving high school, he went to work for The Kansas City Star as a cub reporter.[9] Although he stayed there only for six months, the Star's <a href="#" class="text-link">style guide</a>, which stated "Use short sentences. Use short first paragraphs. Use vigorous English. Be positive, not negative", became a foundation for his prose.[11]

                          Hemingway wanted to go to war and tried to enlist in the <a href="#" class="text-link">U.S Army</a> but was not accepted because he had poor eyesight. Instead he volunteered to a <a href="#" class="text-link">Red Cross</a> recruitment effort in December 1917 and signed on to be an ambulance driver with the American Red Cross Motor Corps in Italy. In May 1918, he sailed from New York, and arrived in Paris as the city was under bombardment from German artillery.[14] That June he arrived at the <a href="#" class="text-link">Italian Front</a>, holding the ranks of second lieutenant (A.R.C.) and sottotenente (Italian Army) simultaneously. On his first day in <a href="#" class="text-link">Milan</a>, he was sent to the scene of a munitions factory explosion to join rescuers retrieving the shredded remains of female workers. He described the incident in his 1932 non-fiction book Death in the Afternoon: "I remember that after we searched quite thoroughly for the complete dead we collected fragments."[16] A few days later, he was stationed at <a href="#" class="text-link">Fossalta di Piave</a>
                       </p>
                       <p>
                           On July 8, right after bringing chocolate and cigarettes from the canteen to the men at the front line, the group came under mortar fire. Hemingway was seriously wounded.[16] Despite his wounds, he assisted Italian soldiers to safety, for which he was decorated with the <a href="#" class="text-link">Italian Wat Merit Cross</a> (Croce al Merito di Guerra) and with the Italian Silver Medal of Military Valor (Medaglia d'argento al valor militare). For his deed, he was promoted to <a href="#" class="text-link">first lieutenant</a> (A.R.C.) and tenente (Italian Army).

                       <p>
                          He was only 18 at the time. Hemingway later said of the incident: "When you go to war as a boy you have a great illusion of immortality. Other people get killed; not you ... Then when you are badly wounded the first time you lose that illusion and you know it can happen to you."[20] He sustained severe shrapnel wounds to both legs, underwent an immediate operation at a distribution center, and spent five days at a field hospital, before he was transferred for recuperation to the Red Cross hospital in Milan.[21] He spent six months at the hospital, where he met <a href="#" class="text-link">"Chink" Dorman-Smith</a>. The two formed a strong friendship that lasted for decades.[22]

                          Anderson suggested Paris because it was inexpensive and it was where "the most interesting people in the world" resided. There Hemingway would meet writers such as <a href="#" class="text-link">Gertrude Stein</a>, <a href="#" class="text-link">James Joyce</a> and <a href="#" class="text-link">Ezra Pound</a> who "could help a young writer up the rungs of a career". Hemingway was a "tall, handsome, muscular, broad-shouldered, brown-eyed, rosy-cheeked, square-jawed, soft-voiced young man." He lived with Hadley in a small walk-up at 74 rue du Cardinal Lemoine [fr] in the <a href="#" class="text-link">Latin Quarter</a>, and rented a room nearby for work. Stein, who was the bastion of modernism in Paris, became Hemingway's mentor and godmother to his son Jack; she introduced him to the expatriate artists and writers of the <a href="#" class="text-link">Montparnasse Quarter</a>, whom she referred to as the "Lost Generation"—a term Hemingway popularized with the publication of The Sun Also Rises. A regular at Stein's salon, Hemingway met influential painters such as <a href="#" class="text-link">Pablo Picasso</a>, <a href="#" class="text-link">Joan Miró</a>, <a href="#" class="text-link">Juan Gris</a>, and Luis Quintanilla. He eventually withdrew from Stein's influence, and their relationship deteriorated into a literary quarrel that spanned decades.

                       <p>
                           Pound was older than Hemingway by 14 years when they met by chance in 1922 at Sylvia Beach's bookstore <a href="#" class="text-link">Shakespeare and Company</a>. They visited Italy in 1923 and lived on the same street in 1924. The two forged a strong friendship; in Hemingway Pound recognized and fostered a young talent. Pound—who had just finished editing <a href="#" class="text-link">T. S. Eliot's</a> The Waste Land—introduced Hemingway to the Irish writer James Joyce, with whom Hemingway frequently embarked on "alcoholic sprees".
                       </p>
                       <p>
                          During his first 20 months in Paris, Hemingway filed 88 stories for the Toronto Star newspaper He covered the <a href="#" class="text-link">Greco-Turkish War</a>, where he witnessed the <a href="#" class="text-link">burning of Smyrna</a>, and wrote travel pieces such as "Tuna Fishing in Spain" and "Trout Fishing All Across Europe: Spain Has the Best, Then Germany". Almost all his fiction and short stories were lost, when in December 1922 as she was traveling to join him in <a href="#" class="text-link">Geneva</a>, Hadley lost a suitcase filled with his manuscripts at the train station Gare de Lyon. He was devastated and furious. Nine months later the couple returned to Toronto, where their son <a href="#" class="text-link">John Hadley Nicanor</a> was born on October 10, 1923. During their absence, Hemingway's first book, Three Stories and Ten Poems, was published in Paris. All that remained after the loss of the suitcase were two of the stories the volume contained; he wrote the third story early in 1923 while in Italy. A few months later, in our time (without capitals) was produced in Paris. The small volume included 18 <a href="#" class="text-link">vignettes</a>, a dozen of which he wrote the previous summer during his first visit to Spain, where he discovered the thrill of the <a href="#" class="text-link">corrida</a>. He considered Toronto boring, missed Paris, and wanted to return to the life of a writer, rather than live the life of a journalist.
